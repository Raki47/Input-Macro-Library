# Input-Macro-Library
Simple Input macro library currently made for both Windows and MacOS, multiple different version to choose from based on preference.

# What Is planned for the future
- Expanding input.h
- Rewriting It In assembly language for Windows x86 and x64, ARM64 (MacOS) and linux x86 and x64
- Rewriting It In Python
- Adding extra functionality to the libraries rather than only Including convenient key macros
- Using It In a project myself to verify that It works as It should, there are no errors within the code but it's best to be sure

# input.h
A single header library for made for C and C++, Includes Virtual keycodes of all the common keys as well as the ones that can't be used
without virtual keycodes and macros.

# x86_win_input_macro.asm
Translated Into x86 Assembly for Windows, compiles with the <i>MASM32</i> assembler on <i>Visual Studio 2022</i>.

# x86_win_input_macro.asm
Translated Into x64 Assembly for Windows, I Intend on making It compile with the <i>MASM64</i> assembler on <i>Visual Studio 2022</i>,
although currently It does not work, still a work In progress.
